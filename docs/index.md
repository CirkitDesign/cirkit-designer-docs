# Welcome to Cirkit Designer!

Cirkit Designer is an online platform for designing, simulating, and prototyping circuits. It supports microcontroller platforms including Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, IoT systems, and thousands of components contributed by our community.

Here are some quick examples of simulatable circuits built with Cirkit Designer:

- [Pong Game with Arduino UNO and OLED Display](https://app.cirkitdesigner.com/project/0c10f349-34b2-46f2-b428-2b4b8b41b003)
- [Measure Temperature with DHT11 and print to 16x2 LCD Display](https://app.cirkitdesigner.com/project/3aa5bf2c-a799-4f99-9c3a-eea420b89244)
- [Track Time with DS1307 RTC and print to LCD Display](https://app.cirkitdesigner.com/project/374e7696-5d6d-457d-8235-8ab1581fb324)
- [Play a melody to Piezo Buzzer](https://app.cirkitdesigner.com/project/f8a25630-e336-4ebe-92e0-2bf0aaf57f54)
