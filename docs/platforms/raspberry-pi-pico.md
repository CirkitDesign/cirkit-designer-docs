# Raspberry Pi Pico Simulation

The Raspberry Pi Pico is an RP2040 microcontroller board with a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor, 264KB of internal RAM, and flexible Programmable I/O (PIO). It runs at 125 MHz.

---

## Getting Started

Place a Raspberry Pi Pico on the canvas and open the code editor by clicking on the Code tab. Write your Arduino sketch using the standard Arduino API.

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial) {
    delay(10); // wait for USB serial connection
  }
  Serial.println("Hello, Pico!");
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(500);
}
```

:::note
USB Serial setup takes a moment. Use `while (!Serial)` in `setup()` to wait for the connection before printing, or messages may be lost.

## Pin Layout

Pins GP0–GP28 are digital GPIO pins. GP26, GP27, and GP28 also support analog input.

### Analog Input Pins

| Pin | Analog Channel |
|-----|---------------|
| GP26 | 0 |
| GP27 | 1 |
| GP28 | 2 |

### Power Pins

The simulator exposes the following power pins:

| Pin | Voltage |
|-----|---------|
| VBUS | 5V |
| VSYS | 5V |
| 3V3 | 3.3V |
| GND | 0V |
| ADC_VREF | 3.3V |

### Special Pin Functions

| Pin | Function | Signal |
|-----|----------|--------|
| GP0 | UART0 | TX |
| GP1 | UART0 | RX |
| GP4 | I2C0 | SDA (Data) |
| GP5 | I2C0 | SCL (Clock) |
| GP16 | SPI0 | MISO (RX) |
| GP18 | SPI0 | SCK (Clock) |
| GP19 | SPI0 | MOSI (TX) |
| GP25 | On-board LED | LED_BUILTIN |

### On-Board LED

The Raspberry Pi Pico has an on-board LED on GPIO pin 25. Use `LED_BUILTIN` to control it:

```cpp
pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
```

## Serial Monitor

The Pi Pico supports two serial interfaces:

- **`Serial`** — communicates over USB (CDC). This is the default for the Serial Monitor.
- **`Serial1`** — communicates over UART0 (GP0 TX, GP1 RX).

USB Serial requires a brief setup time. Always wait for the connection in `setup()`:

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial) {
    delay(10);
  }
  Serial.println("Connected!");
}
```

---

## Simulation Speed

The Raspberry Pi Pico runs at a 125 MHz clock frequency, matching real hardware.

---

## Practical Limitations

- **Single core only** — only one of the two ARM Cortex-M0+ cores is simulated
- **SPI and I2C are master mode only** — slave mode is not supported
- **DMA is limited to PIO** — DMA for other peripherals is not yet supported
- **Timing may differ slightly from real hardware** — most Arduino code is unaffected
