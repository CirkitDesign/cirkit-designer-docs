# ESP32-S3 Simulation

The ESP32-S3 is a WiFi-enabled dual-core microcontroller from Espressif, widely used for IoT projects. Cirkit Designer supports Arduino sketch projects on the ESP32-S3.

:::note
**ESP-IDF project support in Cirkit Designer is coming soon.**
:::

## Getting Started

Place an ESP32-S3 development board on the canvas and open the code editor by clicking on the Code tab. Write your Arduino sketch using familiar APIs like `Serial`, `digitalWrite`, `analogRead`, and WiFi libraries.

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  delay(500);
}
```

## Simulation Speed

To keep the simulation running in real time, Cirkit Designer limits the simulated CPU frequency. This does not affect peripheral timing — `millis()`, `delay()`, UART baud rates, and timer intervals all remain accurate. It only limits how fast instructions execute, which matters for compute-heavy loops.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **8 MHz** (default) | Fastest simulation. Works for most projects |
| **16 MHz** | More instruction throughput for compute-heavy code |
| **Max** | Native hardware speed (240 MHz). Slowest simulation |

Most Arduino projects work well at the default 8 MHz setting. Only increase it if your code has tight computation loops where instruction throughput matters.

## Practical Limitations

- **WiFi requires open networks** — WPA2/WPA3 encryption is not supported. Use the virtual `CirkitWifi` access point (no password)
- **Timing may differ from real hardware** — crypto operations complete instantly, ADC conversions have no delay, and clock behavior is simplified. Most Arduino code is unaffected
- **No Bluetooth** — if your project requires BLE or classic Bluetooth, it cannot be simulated at this time
