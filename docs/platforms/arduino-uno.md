# Arduino Uno Simulation

The Arduino Uno is the most popular board in the Arduino family. It is powered by the ATmega328p chip, which has 32KB of Flash program memory, 2KB of SRAM, and 1KB of EEPROM.

---

## Getting Started

Place an Arduino Uno on the canvas and open the code editor by clicking on the Code tab. Write your Arduino sketch using the standard Arduino API.

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(500);
}
```

## Pin Layout

Pins 0–13 are digital GPIO pins. Pins A0–A5 double as analog input pins in addition to being digital GPIO pins.

Digital pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 have hardware PWM support.

### Power Pins

The simulator exposes the following power pins:

| Pin | Voltage |
|-----|---------|
| 5V | 5V |
| 3.3V | 3.3V |
| GND | 0V |
| Vin | 9V |
| IOREF | 5V |

### Special Pin Functions

| Pin | Function | Signal |
|-----|----------|--------|
| 0 | Serial (USART) | RX |
| 1 | Serial (USART) | TX |
| 2 | External interrupt | INT0 |
| 3 | External interrupt | INT1 |
| 10 | SPI | SS (Chip select) |
| 11 | SPI | MOSI |
| 12 | SPI | MISO |
| 13 | SPI | SCLK (Clock) |
| A4 | I2C | SDA (Data) |
| A5 | I2C | SCL (Clock) |

### On-Board LED

The built-in LED on digital pin 13 is simulated. Use `LED_BUILTIN` to control it:

```cpp
pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
```

## Simulation Speed

The Arduino Uno runs at a 16 MHz clock frequency, matching real hardware.

---

## Practical Limitations

- **SPI and I2C are master mode only** — slave mode is not supported
- **No analog comparator** — if your project uses the analog comparator, it cannot be simulated at this time
- **Timing may differ slightly from real hardware** — most Arduino code is unaffected
